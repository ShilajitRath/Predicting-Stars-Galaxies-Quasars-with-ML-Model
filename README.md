## 📜 Dataset Information

The dataset used for this model is from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey).

- The dataset contains **10,000 observations** of space taken by the SDSS.
- Each observation is described by **17 feature columns** and **1 class column**, which identifies it as a **⭐ Star, 🌌 Galaxy, or ✨ Quasar**.
- **70%** of the dataset is used for training, while **30%** is used for testing.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

1. 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier** - A tree-based model that splits the data based on feature conditions to classify objects.
2. 🔍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** - A distance-based algorithm that classifies objects based on their closest neighbors.
3. 📈 **Logistic Regression Classifier** - A statistical model that predicts probabilities to classify objects.
