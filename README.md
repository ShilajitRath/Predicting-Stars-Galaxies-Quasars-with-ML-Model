## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this model is from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey).

- The dataset contains **10,000 observations** of space taken by the SDSS.
- Each observation is described by **17 feature columns** and **1 class column**, which identifies it as a **star, galaxy, or quasar**.
- **70%** of the dataset is used for training, while **30%** is used for testing.
